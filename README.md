# ChampSelect â€“ Champion Draft Recommendation via A* Search
This Java project implements a champion selection algorithm for League of Legends using A* search. It recommends optimized champion picks based on synergy, counter-matchups, pick order, and role constraints. Each node in the search tree represents a partial draft, and the algorithm prioritizes balanced and safe team compositions.
